```R
# This code correctly subsets a data frame by ensuring the logical vector's
# length matches the data frame's number of rows.  It also includes error handling.

df <- data.frame(a = 1:10, b = letters[1:10])

# Correct way to create the logical vector that matches the dataframe size
logical_vector <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(df), replace = TRUE)

# Check if the lengths match and report an error if they don't.
if (length(logical_vector) != nrow(df)) {
  stop("Error: Length of logical vector does not match number of rows in data frame.")
}

subset_df <- df[logical_vector, ]

#Print the subsetted dataframe to verify correct subsetting
print(subset_df)
